Exercise 9
==========

1. Randomly delete a line from a `sample.txt` (read and write to the file)
2. `sample.txt` can be generated using `gen_a.py` and `gen_n.py`
3. In more advanced mode generate a comment at start of `sample.txt`, specify last update time plus list of selection lines (delete from file). Check `target.txt` as a sample.
